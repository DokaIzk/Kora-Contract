# @kora-protocol/sdk

TypeScript client bindings for the [Kora Protocol](https://github.com/your-org/kora-contract) — on-chain invoice financing on Stellar Soroban.

## Install

```bash
npm install @kora-protocol/sdk
```

## Quick start — mint → list → fund → repay on testnet

```ts
import { KoraClient } from "@kora-protocol/sdk";
import { Keypair } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

// Load your deployment addresses (from deployments/testnet.json)
const addresses = {
  invoiceNft:    "C...",
  marketplace:   "C...",
  financingPool: "C...",
  treasury:      "C...",
  riskRegistry:  "C...",
  accessControl: "C...",
  priceOracle:   "C...",
};

const kora = new KoraClient(addresses, KoraClient.TESTNET);

const sme      = Keypair.fromSecret("S...");
const investor = Keypair.fromSecret("S...");
const USDC     = "C..."; // testnet USDC contract address

// 1. Mint an invoice NFT
const invoiceId = await kora.invoiceNft.mintInvoice(
  sme,
  Buffer.alloc(32, 0xab),          // SHA-256 of debtor info
  10_000_000_000n,                 // 10,000 USDC (7 decimals)
  "USDC",
  BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86_400 * 60), // due in 60 days
  "bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi",
  30,                              // risk score → RiskTier::AA
);
console.log("Minted invoice", invoiceId);

// 2. List the invoice on the marketplace (5% discount)
await kora.marketplace.listInvoice(
  sme,
  invoiceId,
  9_500_000_000n,  // asking price
  10_000_000_000n, // face value
  USDC,
  BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86_400 * 30), // 30-day funding window
);

// 3. Investor funds the invoice
await kora.marketplace.fundInvoice(investor, invoiceId, 9_500_000_000n);

// 4. SME repays the face value
await kora.financingPool.repay(sme, invoiceId, USDC, 10_000_000_000n);

// 5. Read final state
const invoice = await kora.invoiceNft.getInvoice(invoiceId);
console.log("Invoice status:", invoice.status); // "Repaid"

const collected = await kora.treasury.getCollected(USDC);
console.log("Treasury collected fees:", collected);
```

## Recovering an interrupted transaction

If the RPC connection drops after submission, a write can reject with
`TransactionOutcomeUnknownError`. Its `hash` identifies the transaction; the
error does not imply that the transaction failed. Reconcile after connectivity
returns instead of resubmitting:

```ts
import { TransactionOutcomeUnknownError } from "@kora-protocol/sdk";

try {
  await kora.marketplace.fundInvoice(investor, invoiceId, amount);
} catch (error) {
  if (!(error instanceof TransactionOutcomeUnknownError)) throw error;

  const status = await kora.reconcileTransaction(error.hash);
  if (status.status === "success") {
    // The ledger confirms the transaction; refresh affected contract state.
  } else if (status.status === "failed") {
    // The ledger confirms failure; the user may choose whether to retry.
  } else {
    // NOT_FOUND is inconclusive. Keep the transaction unresolved and check again.
  }
}
```

`KoraClient.reconcileTransaction` queries Soroban RPC transaction status. A
successful or failed result is authoritative; `not_found` and RPC errors are
not evidence of failure. Applications should retain the hash and unresolved
transaction state across wallet/network reconnection, retry reconciliation
when RPC access returns, and only offer a new submission after a confirmed
failure or an explicit user decision. Wallet connection state is owned by the
integrating application; this SDK API provides the on-chain status needed to
recover its transaction tracker.

## Contract clients

| Client | Contract |
|---|---|
| `kora.invoiceNft` | `invoice_nft` — mint, get, status transitions |
| `kora.marketplace` | `marketplace` — list, fund, cancel, tier fees |
| `kora.financingPool` | `financing_pool` — repay, pools, positions |
| `kora.treasury` | `treasury` — balances, collected fees, withdraw |
| `kora.riskRegistry` | `risk_registry` — SME/verifier management |
| `kora.accessControl` | `access_control` — pause/unpause, roles |
| `kora.priceOracle` | `price_oracle` — asset prices |

## Public API (third-party integrators)

The SDK also ships a typed client for the **rate-limited public API tier**
(`services/public-api/`), which sits in front of the core API gateway and is
intended for external integrators (factoring partners, analytics providers).
Unlike the internal service-to-service APIs, every request is authenticated
with an API key, metered per key, and rate limited according to the key's tier.

### Issuing a key

Keys are issued self-service or admin-approved and carry a configurable tier
that determines the rate limit and quota:

```ts
import { PublicApiClient } from "@kora-protocol/sdk";

// Self-service issuance (returns the plaintext key exactly once).
const { key, tier } = await PublicApiClient.issueKey({
  label: "acme-factoring",
  tier: "partner", // "free" | "partner" | "enterprise"
});

// Admin-approved issuance with a custom tier limit.
const approved = await PublicApiClient.issueKey({
  label: "acme-analytics",
  tier: "enterprise",
  requestsPerMinute: 6_000,
  approvedBy: "admin@kora.example",
});
```

### Calling the versioned API

All public endpoints are versioned under `/v1/...` so the surface can evolve
without breaking existing integrations:

```ts
const api = new PublicApiClient({
  baseUrl: "https://api.kora.example",
  apiKey: key,
});

const invoice = await api.v1.invoices.get(invoiceId);
const page    = await api.v1.invoices.list({ status: "Listed", limit: 50 });
```

### Rate limits and metering

Rate limiting uses a per-key token bucket (sliding-window refill) sized by the
key's tier. Every request is metered and written to a queryable usage store for
reporting:

```ts
const usage = await api.v1.usage.get({ from: "2024-01-01", to: "2024-02-01" });
console.log(usage.requests, usage.rateLimited, usage.remaining);
```

When a key exceeds its tier limit the API responds with `429 Too Many Requests`
and `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-*` headers.

### Revocation

Revoked keys are rejected immediately — there is no stale-token grace period.
Revocation takes effect on the next request:

```ts
await PublicApiClient.revokeKey(key); // effective immediately
```

### Versioning & deprecation policy

- The public surface is versioned by path prefix (`/v1/...`).
- New, non-breaking fields and endpoints are added within the current version.
- Breaking changes ship under a new version prefix (`/v2/...`); the previous
  version remains available for a documented deprecation window.
- Deprecated endpoints return a `Deprecation` header and are announced in the
  changelog before removal.
