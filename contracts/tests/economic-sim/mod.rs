//! Economic Attack Simulation Harness
//!
//! This module models economically-motivated attacks against marketplace/financing_pool
//! mechanics to verify no exploitable strategy yields attacker profit beyond documented
//! acceptable bounds.
//!
//! ## Assumed Attacker Capital Bound
//!
//! All scenarios assume the attacker has access to:
//! - Up to 10M USDC (or equivalent) in liquid capital
//! - Multiple coordinated addresses (up to 10 colluding accounts)
//! - Ability to execute transactions in rapid succession within single ledger
//!
//! This bound represents a well-funded but not nation-state-level adversary,
//! appropriate for the protocol's expected early-stage scale.
//!
//! ## Attack Profitability Threshold
//!
//! An attack is considered "exploitable" if:
//! - Net attacker profit > 1% of capital deployed, OR
//! - Attacker can disrupt protocol operation for >100 ledgers with <1M capital
//!
//! Attacks below this threshold are documented but not necessarily fixed, as
//! they represent economically irrational behavior given gas costs and opportunity cost.
