//! Fund-then-refund volume gaming attack simulation
//!
//! ## Attack Vector
//!
//! An attacker attempts to manipulate the tiered-fee structure by:
//! 1. Rapidly funding multiple listings to accumulate volume
//! 2. Triggering two-phase cancellation on those listings
//! 3. Claiming refunds to recover capital
//! 4. Repeating to artificially inflate their volume tier for lower fees on genuine investments
//!
//! ## Expected Defenses
//!
//! - Fees are collected upfront and not refunded even on cancellation
//! - Volume tracking excludes cancelled/refunded contributions
//! - Refund mechanism has time delays preventing rapid cycling
