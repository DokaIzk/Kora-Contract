# MEV and Transaction-Ordering Risk Analysis for Kora Protocol

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the Kora Protocol's exposure to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and transaction-ordering attacks specific to the Stellar/Soroban execution environment. After thorough analysis of Stellar's consensus model and Kora's critical transaction flows, we conclude that **Stellar/Soroban's architectural properties provide strong intrinsic MEV resistance** that materially differs from Ethereum's MEV surface.

**Key Findings:**
- Stellar's deterministic transaction ordering and 1-tx-per-account-per-ledger constraint eliminate most classic MEV vectors
- The protocol's time-sensitive operations (funding, secondary market, fee tiers) face minimal front-running risk due to Stellar consensus properties
- Identified risks are mitigated through existing protocol design patterns
- No additional mitigation mechanisms required beyond current implementation

## 1. Stellar/Soroban Transaction Ordering Guarantees

### 1.1 Core Consensus Properties

**Source:** [Stellar Transaction Submission](https://stellar.org/developers-blog/proposed-changes-to-transaction-submission)

Stellar enforces **one transaction per source account per ledger** (since Protocol 20). This architectural constraint fundamentally alters the MEV landscape:

1. **Sequential Account Execution**: Account A cannot have multiple transactions competing for ordering within a single ledger
2. **Deterministic Processing**: Transactions enter a queue and are processed deterministically based on:
   - Fee priority during surge pricing
   - Arrival order when fees are equal
   - Per-account serialization

3. **Atomic Settlement**: Soroban transactions execute with **serializable consistency semantics** - once in a ledger, execution order is deterministic and non-reorderable

### 1.2 Implications for MEV

**What This Prevents:**
- **Sandwich attacks**: An attacker cannot insert transactions before AND after a target transaction from the same account
- **Intra-block reordering**: Unlike Ethereum where miners/validators can reorder transactions within a block, Stellar's consensus produces a deterministic transaction set

**What Remains Possible:**
- **Cross-account coordination**: Multiple accounts could theoretically coordinate, but with no ordering guarantee between accounts
- **Surge pricing manipulation**: During network congestion, higher fees win - but this is transparent and economically rational, not extractive

## 2. Risk Analysis by Transaction Flow

### 2.1 Marketplace Funding (`fund_invoice`)

**Location:** `contracts/marketplace/src/lib.rs::fund_invoice_internal()`

**Sensitive State Transitions:**
1. Checking `listing.funded_amount` vs `asking_price`
2. Fee tier application based on `invoice.risk_tier`
3. Token conversion via price oracle
4. Investor concentration cap checks

**Attack Scenario - Fee Tier Boundary Crossing:**

*Hypothetical*: Investor observes pending protocol-wide fee tier update and attempts to front-run their funding to lock in the lower rate.

**Mitigation - Why This Doesn't Work:**

```rust
// Code ref: marketplace/src/lib.rs lines ~785-792
let effective_fee_bps: u32 = match env
    .storage()
    .instance()
    .get(&DataKey::TierFeeBps(Self::tier_ordinal(&invoice.risk_tier)))
{
    Some(tier_fee) => tier_fee,
    None => Self::base_fee_bps(&env, &config)?,
};
```

1. **Read-time consistency**: Fee is fetched during execution, not at submission time
2. **No ordering games**: Due to 1-tx-per-account-per-ledger, an attacker cannot race their own governance transaction
3. **Timelocked governance**: Fee changes go through `access_control` timelock (from `UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_DELAY`), giving all participants advance notice

**Risk Level:** ✅ **Negligible** - Existing timelock and Stellar ordering eliminate front-running opportunity

### 2.2 Secondary Market Settlement (`buy_position`)

**Location:** `contracts/secondary_market/src/lib.rs::buy_position()`

**Sensitive State Transitions:**
1. Listing existence check
2. Pool closed status verification
3. Position transfer atomicity

**Attack Scenario - Position Sniping:**

*Hypothetical*: Attacker monitors pending `list_position` transactions and attempts to buy immediately when listing appears.

**Mitigation - Why This Doesn't Work:**

```rust
// Code ref: secondary_market/src/lib.rs lines ~237-245
// Checks-effects-interactions: clear the listing before external calls.
env.storage()
    .persistent()
    .remove(&DataKey::Listing(invoice_id, seller.clone()));

// Settle payment: fee to treasury, remainder to seller.
let fee = bps_of(listing.price, fee_bps)?;
let seller_proceeds = safe_sub(listing.price, fee)?;
```

1. **Atomic execution**: Once `list_position` is in a ledger, `buy_position` can only occur in a subsequent ledger (minimum ~5 seconds)
2. **No intra-ledger races**: Multiple buyers submitting in the same ledger face deterministic ordering, not miner-controlled ordering
3. **Checks-effects-interactions pattern**: Storage cleared before external calls prevents reentrancy and state inconsistency

**Risk Level:** ✅ **Acceptable** - First-come-first-served is economically fair when ordering is deterministic and transparent

### 2.3 Cross-Currency Funding with Oracle Conversion

**Location:** `contracts/marketplace/src/lib.rs` lines ~750-775

**Sensitive State Transitions:**
1. Oracle price fetch
2. Cross-currency amount conversion
3. Remaining target validation

**Attack Scenario - Oracle Front-Running:**

*Hypothetical*: Investor observes favorable oracle price update pending and races to fund before price changes.

**Mitigation - Why This Doesn't Work:**

```rust
// Code ref: marketplace/src/lib.rs lines ~755-765
let listing_amount = if pay_token == listing.token {
    amount
} else {
    Self::require_whitelisted_token(env, &pay_token)?;
    let converted = Self::convert_via_oracle(env, &config, amount, &pay_token, &listing.token)?;
    require_within_max_amount(converted)?;
    converted
};
```

1. **Execution-time pricing**: Oracle price is fetched during contract execution, not based on stale client assumptions
2. **No ordering advantage**: Oracle updates are themselves transactions subject to the same ordering rules
3. **Conversion happens atomically**: No gap between price check and conversion where state could change

**Residual Risk:** Oracle manipulation is a separate attack category (not MEV) - addressed by oracle design (multiple price sources, deviation checks, update frequency limits).

**Risk Level:** ✅ **Negligible for MEV** - Oracle manipulation is a data integrity issue, not a transaction-ordering issue

### 2.4 Concentration Cap Boundary (`MaxInvestorShareBps`)

**Location:** `contracts/marketplace/src/lib.rs` lines ~718-744

**Attack Scenario - Cap Gaming:**

*Hypothetical*: Investor with 9.9% of pool watches for another large investor to hit their cap, then quickly funds to claim remaining allocation before others.

**Mitigation - Why This Doesn't Work:**

```rust
// Code ref: marketplace/src/lib.rs lines ~730-742
if lhs > rhs {
    events::investor_concentration_exceeded(
        &env,
        invoice_id,
        &investor,
        prospective,
        cap_bps,
    );
    return Err(KoraError::InvestorConcentrationExceeded);
}
```

1. **Per-investor enforcement**: Each investor's cap is independent - one hitting their cap doesn't create an "opportunity" for others
2. **Transparent failure**: Rejection is deterministic based on stored state at execution time
3. **No value extraction**: Getting to fund "first" after a cap hit provides no economic advantage - everyone pays the same fee rate

**Risk Level:** ✅ **Acceptable** - First-funded first-served is fair when state transitions are deterministic

### 2.5 Priority Allocation Windows (`PriorityWindow`)

**Location:** `contracts/marketplace/src/lib.rs` lines ~102-112, enforcement in `require_priority_window_allowed`

**Attack Scenario - Window Expiry Front-Running:**

*Hypothetical*: Non-whitelisted investor monitors priority window expiry timestamp and submits funding transaction timed to execute exactly at window_end + 1.

**Mitigation - Why This Is Acceptable:**

```rust
// Code ref: marketplace/src/lib.rs (PriorityWindow struct)
pub struct PriorityWindow {
    pub whitelist: Vec<Address>,
    pub window_end: u64,
}
// Enforcement: while env.ledger().timestamp() <= window_end, only whitelist allowed
```

1. **Time-based, not order-based**: Access opens based on `env.ledger().timestamp()`, which advances monotonically per ledger
2. **No extraction opportunity**: Everyone after `window_end` has equal access - no value in being "first" post-expiry
3. **Intentional design**: Priority windows are meant to advantage specific investors for a period, then open to all

**Risk Level:** ✅ **Acceptable by design** - Timing the window expiry provides no unfair advantage

---

## 3. Systemic Risk Assessment

### 3.1 Stellar Consensus Properties (SCP)

Stellar Consensus Protocol provides:
- **Federated Byzantine Agreement**: Validators reach consensus on transaction sets before execution
- **Non-manipulable ordering within transaction set**: Once a transaction set is agreed upon, execution order is deterministic
- **Transparent surge pricing**: During congestion, fee-based prioritization is algorithmically enforced, not discretionary

### 3.2 What Stellar DOESN'T Have (Compared to Ethereum)

| Ethereum MEV Vector | Stellar Equivalent | Kora Impact |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Miner transaction reordering | Deterministic execution order | ✅ Eliminated |
| Intra-block sandwich attacks | 1-tx-per-account-per-ledger | ✅ Eliminated |
| Flashbots private mempools | Public transaction queue | ✅ No hidden ordering |
| Uncle blocks / reorgs | Finality within seconds | ✅ No reorg risk |
| Gas price auctions | Transparent fee priority | ⚠️ Economically rational, not extractive |

### 3.3 Identified Attack Surfaces with Mitigation Status

| Attack Surface | Risk Level | Mitigation | Status |
|----------------|------------|------------|--------|
| Fee tier boundary crossing | Low | Timelocked governance updates | ✅ Mitigated |
| Secondary market listing sniping | Low | Deterministic ordering, atomic execution | ✅ Acceptable |
| Oracle price front-running | Low | Execution-time pricing, atomic conversion | ✅ Mitigated |
| Concentration cap gaming | Negligible | Independent per-investor caps | ✅ Acceptable |
| Priority window expiry timing | Negligible | Time-based, not order-based | ✅ By design |
| Surge pricing fee manipulation | Medium | Transparent algorithmic prioritization | ✅ Economically rational |

## 4. Recommendations and Monitoring

### 4.1 Accepted Risks (No Code Changes Required)

**Rationale:** The following behaviors are economically rational and do not represent extractive MEV:

1. **Higher-fee-wins during congestion**: This is transparent and allows urgent transactions to be prioritized - a feature, not a bug
2. **First-funded-first-served for equal-fee transactions**: With deterministic ordering, this is fair
3. **Priority window timing**: Intentional design to advantage specific investor classes

### 4.2 Operational Best Practices

**For Protocol Operators:**
1. **Monitor surge pricing events**: Track when the network enters surge pricing to understand user experience during congestion
2. **Oracle update frequency**: Ensure price oracle updates are frequent enough that stale prices don't create arbitrage (separate from MEV)
3. **Timelock transparency**: Always communicate governance parameter changes during timelock period

**For Frontend/Integrators:**
1. **Simulate transactions before submission**: Use Soroban's simulation API to preview execution outcomes
2. **Avoid stale assumptions**: Don't rely on client-side cached prices - let contracts fetch fresh oracle data
3. **Fee estimation**: During surge pricing, provide users with fee estimates that increase likelihood of inclusion

### 4.3 Future Protocol Changes to Monitor

**If Stellar changes the following, re-evaluate:**
- Introduction of private transaction pools
- Changes to surge pricing algorithm
- Relaxation of 1-tx-per-account-per-ledger constraint
- Addition of validator-controlled transaction ordering

---

## 5. Conclusion

**Stellar/Soroban's architectural decisions provide strong intrinsic MEV resistance** compared to chains with miner/validator-controlled transaction ordering. The Kora Protocol's time-sensitive mechanics (funding, secondary market trading, fee tier boundaries) operate within this environment with minimal extractive front-running risk.

The identified "risks" are primarily **economically rational behaviors** (paying higher fees for priority) rather than extractive MEV. The protocol's existing patterns (timelocked governance, atomic operations, execution-time state reads) align well with Stellar's ordering model.

**No additional MEV-specific mitigations are required** beyond the existing implementation. Continued monitoring of Stellar consensus changes and operational best practices for oracle management and surge pricing response remain appropriate.
