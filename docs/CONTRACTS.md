# Kora Protocol — Contract Reference

Complete reference for all public contract functions, their parameters, return values, and failure modes.

All amounts are in **stroops** (1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops). For stablecoins like USDC on Stellar, 1 USDC = 10,000,000 units.

### `release_funds(marketplace, invoice_id)`

Called by marketplace when an invoice is fully funded. Creates the pool record and transitions the NFT to `Funded`.

Errors: `PoolAlreadyClosed`, `InvoiceNotFound`

---

### `record_position(caller, invoice_id, investor, contributed, total_pool)`

Records an investor's position in the pool. Admin only (called internally).

---

### `repay(payer, invoice_id, token, amount)`

SME repays the invoice. If fully repaid, distributes yield to all investors and marks NFT as `Repaid`.

**Late penalty model:** On the first repayment call where `ledger.timestamp > invoice.due_date`, a one-time flat penalty of `bps_of(face_value, late_penalty_bps)` is added to `total_owed`. Subsequent repayments (partial or full) are tracked against `total_owed` so the penalty is never double-counted. Uses the same bps conventions as marketplace `fee_bps`.

**Yield distribution precision:** When `is_closed && should_close`, yield is distributed proportionally to each investor based on their `share_bps`. Due to integer division in basis point calculations, rounding loss is bounded to **≤ position count × 1 stroop**. For up to 50 positions, drift is ≤ 50 stroops (negligible relative to typical invoice amounts). See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed bounds.

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `payer` | `Address` | Must sign. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Repayment amount in stroops. |

Errors: `PoolNotFound`, `RepaymentAlreadyMade`, `ArithmeticOverflow`

## `price_oracle`

### `initialize(admin, access_control)`

| Param | Type | Description |

Fails with `AlreadyInitialized` if called more than once.

---

### `set_rate_curve(caller, points)`

Replaces the tenor-based discount-rate curve. Caller must be admin or a whitelisted verifier.

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `points` | `Vec<(u32, u32)>` | `(tenor_days, rate_bps)` pairs. Must be non-empty, strictly increasing in `tenor_days`, and at most `MAX_CURVE_POINTS` (16) entries. |

Stores the curve in a bounded, sorted vector and records the update timestamp for staleness checks. Rejects out-of-order or non-monotonic tenor inputs with `InvalidCurve`. Rejects curves exceeding the point bound with `TooManyCurvePoints`.

Errors: `Unauthorized`, `InvalidCurve`, `TooManyCurvePoints`, `ProtocolPaused`

---

### `rate_for_tenor(days) → u32`

Returns the discount rate in basis points for a given tenor in days.

| Param | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `days` | `u32` | Days to maturity. |

Uses deterministic integer linear interpolation between the two surrounding curve points. Flat extrapolation is applied at both edges: tenors at or below the first point return the first rate, and tenors at or above the last point return the last rate. No floating-point math is used.
