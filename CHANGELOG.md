## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **#283 Verifier-delegated sub-accounts** — `risk_registry` now supports a primary verifier delegating action rights to N sub-accounts via `add_sub_account` / `remove_sub_account`. All SME registrations and score updates performed by a sub-account are attributed to the primary verifier for reputation and staking purposes. The primary verifier is stored in `SmeProfile.verifier` regardless of which signer performed the action. Sub-accounts cannot themselves be primary verifiers, and an address can only be a sub-account of one primary at a time.
- **#280 Storage rent/TTL cost model guide** — new `docs/storage-rent-cost-model.md` explains Soroban's three storage tiers (persistent / instance / temporary), the TTL constants used in each Kora contract, which keys are most expensive at scale, worked cost projections at 1 000 and 10 000 active invoices, and keeper-bot / archival responsibilities.
- **#276 Treasury contract documentation** — new `docs/treasury.md` covers the full `fee_bps` lifecycle, `withdraw` and `emergency_withdraw` flows with step-by-step ordering, the reentrancy guard design, the rolling 24-hour withdrawal rate-limit, the two-step cap/upgrade timelock, a complete public API table, the storage layout, and a threat-model / security analysis.

### Fixed
- **#343 Duplicate `KoraError` discriminant 95** *(breaking ABI change)* — `EmptyBytes` and `Reentrancy` previously both used discriminant 95, causing any reentrancy violation to be silently decoded as `EmptyBytes` by off-chain clients and preventing the crate from compiling (E0081). Discriminants are now unique: `NoContribution = 95`, `NotInitialized = 96`, `EmptyBytes = 97`, `Reentrancy = 98`. **Clients that pattern-match on `KoraError::Reentrancy` by its raw u32 value must update their discriminant from 95 to 98.**
- **#420 Invoice-lifecycle event schema inconsistencies** *(breaking event-schema change)* — `invoice_defaulted` was missing an `amount` field carried by every sibling invoice event, and none of the seven invoice-lifecycle events (`invoice_created`, `invoice_listed`, `invoice_funded`, `invoice_repaid`, `invoice_amended`, `invoice_withdrawn`, `invoice_defaulted`) included the invoice's `currency`, forcing indexers to make a separate `get_invoice` call to interpret the monetary value. `invoice_defaulted` now carries `amount`, and all seven events now carry `currency` (see `docs/EVENTS.md`). **Off-chain indexers decoding these event tuples by fixed position/arity must update to the new schemas.**

### Changed
- **Removed duplicate sme_invoice_counted event** — use sme_invoice_count_incremented instead across all SME profile tracking (see `contracts/shared/src/events.rs` and AUDIT_LOG.md)

### Planned
- Multisig admin with timelock
- Contract upgrade mechanism
- Secondary market for pool positions
- Keeper network for TTL management
- On-chain FX oracle integration
